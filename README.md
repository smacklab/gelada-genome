# Gelada genome

This repository encompasses code written for analysis of gelada adaptations to high altitude, currently available as a [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.01.458582).

The project code is split into three working folders:

1. [comparative-genomes](comparative-genomes), which encompasses code pertaining to comparisons of the gelada reference genome assembly (Tgel_1.0) to other mammalian genomes, as well as comparative analyses of gelada morphometric and hematological measurements.

2. [population-resequencing](population-resequencing), which encompasses code pertaining to genomic analyses of population resequencing data.

3. [accelerated-regions](accelerated-regions), which encompasses code pertaining to analysis of gelada accelerated regions.
